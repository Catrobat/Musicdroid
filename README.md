# Contributing #

If you want to contribute we suggest that you start with [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) our repository and browse the code. Then you can look at our [Issue-Tracker](https://jira.catrob.at/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=25) and start with fixing one ticket. We strictly use [Test-Driven Development](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) and [Clean Code](http://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf), so first read everything you can about these development methods. Code developed in a different style will not be accepted. 
After you've created a pull request we will review your code and do a full testrun on your branch.

If you want to implement a new feature, please ask about the details in JIRA or our IRC channel (#catrobat-musicdroid) first.
